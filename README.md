        * **Drag & Drop** to reorder toolbar items.
        * Configure everything through a user-friendly interface.

    * For **Document Canvases**, it extracts the text content.
    * The filename is automatically and safely derived from the Canvas title, preserving existing file extensions (e.g., `myScript.js` is saved correctly).

* **üñ±Ô∏è Smart Insertion:** Automatically appends text from snippets or the clipboard to the input field, placing the cursor at the end.

* **üîí CSP Compliant:** Uses safe methods for CSS injection to work with Google's Content Security Policy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

To use this custom recipe in your Ferdium application, follow these steps:

**1. Locate your Ferdium `dev` Recipe Directory:**

    The location depends on your operating system:

    * **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Ferdium\recipes\dev\`
        (Usually `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Ferdium\recipes\dev\`)
    * **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Ferdium/recipes/dev/`
        (You might need to press `Cmd+Shift+G` in Finder and paste the path)
    * **Linux:** `~/.config/Ferdium/recipes/dev/`

    If the `dev` directory doesn't exist, create it.

**2. Get the Recipe Files:**

    You have two options:

    **Option A: Download ZIP Method (Simpler)**

    * <a href="https://github.com/adromir/google-gemini-mod/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" target="_blank">Download the recipe files as a ZIP archive</a>.
    * Extract the ZIP file. You should get a folder named `google-gemini-mod` (or similar).
    * Move this extracted folder **directly** into the `dev` directory you located in Step 1.

        *Example Structure:*
        ```
        .../Ferdium/recipes/dev/
                                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ google-gemini-mod/
                                    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
                                    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ webview.js
                                    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
                                    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (Optional: icon.svg/png if included)
        ```

    **Option B: Using Git (Fork & Clone - Advanced)**

    * **Clone** the repository directly into your `dev` directory:

        ```bash
        # Navigate to Ferdium's dev recipes directory
        cd <path_to_ferdium_dev_recipes>

        # Clone the repository into a folder named 'google-gemini-mod'
        git clone [https://github.com/adromir/google-gemini-mod.git](https://github.com/adromir/google-gemini-mod.git) google-gemini-mod
        ```
        *(Ensure the final folder inside `dev` matches the `id` in `package.json`)*

**3. Restart or Reload Ferdium:**

    * Completely quit and restart Ferdium.
    * *Or*, if Ferdium is running, use `Ctrl+Shift+R` / `Cmd+Shift+R` to reload Ferdium.

**4. Add the Custom Service:**

    * In Ferdium, click the "+" button to add a new service.
    * Click the "Own Services" Button (or search for the recipe name).
    * You should see your custom recipe listed (e.g., "Google Gemini Mod").
    * Select it and add the service as usual.

    The Google Gemini service should now load with the custom folder UI and toolbar! üéâ

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

### 1. Using the Settings Panel (Recommended)

The easiest way to customize the toolbar is through the built-in settings panel.

* **Open the Panel:** Click the **‚öôÔ∏è Settings** button on the far right of the toolbar.
* **Add Items:** Click "Add Toolbar Item" and choose between a "Button" or a "Dropdown".
* **Edit Items:**
    * Change the `label`, `placeholder`, and `snippet text` for any item.
    * For dropdowns, you can add or remove individual options.
* **Reorder Items:** Simply **drag and drop** the item groups within the settings panel to change their order on the toolbar.
* **Remove Items:** Click the "Remove" button on any item.
* **Save:** Click "Save & Close" to apply your changes.

### 2. Customizing Download Behavior (Advanced)

The download functionality relies on specific CSS selectors to find the active Gemini "Canvas" and its buttons. These are defined as constants at the top of `webview.js`.

If the download feature stops working after a Gemini UI update, these selectors might need to be updated by inspecting the Gemini webpage elements with browser developer tools.

**Important:** After making any manual changes to `webview.js`, you must reload the recipe in Ferdium for the changes to take effect:
* Right-click on the Gemini service tab in Ferdium and select "Reload service".
* Or, use the Development menu: "Reload Recipes" / "Reload Ferdium" (`Ctrl+Shift+R` / `Cmd+Shift+R`).

## üìù Notes
* The CSS styles are embedded directly in `webview.js` for compatibility with Google's security policies.
* The folder and toolbar configurations are saved in your browser's `localStorage`. Clearing your Ferdium cache may reset your settings.
* The download feature relies on programmatic clicking and clipboard access. This requires clipboard permissions to be granted to the browser/Ferdium.
