## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

To use this custom recipe in your Ferdium application, follow these steps:

**1. Locate your Ferdium `dev` Recipe Directory:**

   The location depends on your operating system:

   * **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Ferdium\recipes\dev\`
      (Usually `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Ferdium\recipes\dev\`)
   * **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Ferdium/recipes/dev/`
      (You might need to press `Cmd+Shift+G` in Finder and paste the path)
   * **Linux:** `~/.config/Ferdium/recipes/dev/`

   If the `dev` directory doesn't exist, create it.

**2. Get the Recipe Files:**

   You have two options:

   **Option A: Download ZIP Method (Simpler)**

   * Download the recipe files (assuming they are provided as a ZIP archive, e.g., `google-gemini-mod-recipe.zip`).
   * Extract the ZIP file. You should get a folder named `google-gemini-mod` (or similar, containing `package.json`, `webview.js`, `index.js`).
   * Move this extracted folder **directly** into the `dev` directory you located in Step 1.

     *Example Structure:*
     ```
     .../Ferdium/recipes/dev/
                          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ google-gemini-mod/
                              ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
                              ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ webview.js
                              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
                              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (Optional: icon.svg/png if included)
     ```

   **Option B: Using Git (Fork & Clone - Advanced)**

   * **Fork** the repository containing this recipe to your own GitHub/GitLab account (if available).
   * **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone <your-fork-repository-url>
     ```
   * Navigate into the cloned directory and find the specific recipe folder (e.g., `google-gemini-mod`).
   * **Copy** this recipe folder into the Ferdium `dev` directory located in Step 1.

     *Alternatively*, you can clone the repository *directly* into the `dev` directory:

     ```bash
     # Navigate to Ferdium's dev recipes directory
     cd <path_to_ferdium_dev_recipes>

     # Clone the specific recipe repository (or your fork) into a folder named 'google-gemini-mod'
     git clone <repository-url> google-gemini-mod
     ```
     *(Ensure the final folder inside `dev` is named `google-gemini-mod` or matches the `id` in `package.json`)*

**3. Restart or Reload Ferdium:**

   * Completely quit and restart Ferdium.
   * *Or*, if Ferdium is running, use `Ctrl+Shift+R` / `Cmd+Shift+R` to reload Ferdium.

**4. Add the Custom Service:**

   * In Ferdium, click the "+" button to add a new service.
   * Click the "Own Services" Button (or search for the recipe name).
   * You should see your custom recipe listed (e.g., "Google Gemini Mod").
   * Select it and add the service as usual.

   The Google Gemini service should now load with the custom snippet toolbar at the top! üéâ

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

You can easily tailor the toolbar buttons and dropdowns to your needs by editing the `webview.js` file within the recipe's folder (`.../Ferdium/recipes/dev/google-gemini-mod/webview.js`).

Open `webview.js` in a text editor. Look for these sections near the top:

**1. Customizing Buttons:**

   Find the `buttonSnippets` array:
   ```javascript
   const buttonSnippets = [
     { label: "Greeting", text: "Hello Gemini!" },
     { label: "Explain", text: "Could you please explain ... in more detail?" },
     // Add more button snippets here
     // Example: { label: "My Button", text: "My snippet text..." }
   ];
Edit: Change the label (what appears on the button) and text (what gets inserted).Add: Copy an existing line { label: "...", text: "..." }, and modify it.Remove: Delete the line corresponding to the button you want to remove.2. Customizing Dropdowns:Find the dropdownConfigurations array:const dropdownConfigurations = [
  {
    placeholder: "Actions...", // Text shown before selection
    options: [
      { label: "Summarize", text: "Please summarize the following text:\n" },
      { label: "Ideas", text: "Give me 5 ideas for ..." },
      // Add more options here: { label: "Option Name", text: "Snippet..." }
    ]
  },
  {
    placeholder: "Translations",
    options: [
      { label: "DE -> EN", text: "Translate the following into English:\n" },
      { label: "EN -> DE", text: "Translate the following into German:\n" },
    ]
  },
  // Add more dropdown objects here
  // Example:
  // {
  //   placeholder: "My Prompts",
  //   options: [
  //     { label: "Blog Post Idea", text: "Generate 5 blog post ideas about..." },
  //     { label: "Email Draft", text: "Draft a polite email regarding..." }
  //   ]
  // }
];
Edit Options: Modify the label and text within the options array of a specific dropdown.Add Options: Add more { label: "...", text: "..." } objects to an existing options array.Edit Placeholder: Change the placeholder text for a dropdown.Add Dropdowns: Copy an entire dropdown object { placeholder: "...", options: [...] }, and customize it.Remove Dropdowns/Options: Delete the relevant lines or objects.Important: After saving changes to webview.js, you must reload the recipe in Ferdium for the changes to take effect:Right-click on the Gemini service tab in Ferdium and select "Reload service".Or, use the Development menu: "Reload Recipes" / "Reload Ferdium" (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R).üìù NotesThe CSS styles are embedded directly in webview.js for compatibility with Google's security policies. You can modify the embeddedCSS constant within the script if you need to adjust the toolbar's appearance.Ensure you have a stable internet connection when using the service,
