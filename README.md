This recipe enhances the Google Gemini service within the [Ferdium](https://ferdium.org/) application by adding a customizable toolbar for quick insertion of predefined text snippets and a feature to download the content of an active Gemini "Canvas".

## ‚ú® Features

* **üìå Fixed Toolbar:** Adds a persistent toolbar at the top of the Google Gemini interface.
* **‚ö° Quick Snippets:** Define buttons for frequently used phrases or commands. Click a button to instantly append its text to the Gemini input field.
* **üìö Dropdown Menus:** Organize snippets into multiple dropdown menus for better categorization (e.g., Actions, Translations, Custom Prompts).
* **üìã Paste from Clipboard:** A dedicated button in the toolbar to paste content from your system clipboard directly into the Gemini input field.
* **üíæ Download Canvas Content:** A new button in the toolbar that allows you to download the content of the currently active/visible Gemini "Canvas".
    * It cleverly uses the Canvas's own "Copy to Clipboard" functionality.
    * The filename is automatically derived from the Canvas title.
    * It attempts to preserve existing file extensions from the Canvas title (e.g., `myScript.js` will be saved as `myScript.js`, not `myScript_js.txt`).
* **üñ±Ô∏è Smart Insertion (for Snippets/Paste):** Automatically appends text to the input field, placing the cursor correctly.
* **üé® Customizable:** Easily modify the buttons, dropdowns, and snippet text directly within the recipe's `webview.js` file.
* **üåì Dark Mode Sync:** Attempts to respect Ferdium's dark mode setting by interacting with `localStorage`.
* **üîí CSP Compliant:** Uses safe methods for CSS injection to work with Google's Content Security Policy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

To use this custom recipe in your Ferdium application, follow these steps:

**1. Locate your Ferdium `dev` Recipe Directory:**

    The location depends on your operating system:

    * **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Ferdium\recipes\dev\`
        (Usually `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Ferdium\recipes\dev\`)
    * **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Ferdium/recipes/dev/`
        (You might need to press `Cmd+Shift+G` in Finder and paste the path)
    * **Linux:** `~/.config/Ferdium/recipes/dev/`

    If the `dev` directory doesn't exist, create it.

**2. Get the Recipe Files:**

    You have two options:

    **Option A: Download ZIP Method (Simpler)**

    * <a href="https://github.com/adromir/google-gemini-mod/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" target="_blank">Download the recipe files</a> (assuming they are provided as a ZIP archive, e.g., `main.zip`).
    * Extract the ZIP file. You should get a folder named `google-gemini-mod` (or similar, containing `package.json`, `webview.js`, `index.js`).
    * Move this extracted folder **directly** into the `dev` directory you located in Step 1.

        *Example Structure:*
        ```
        .../Ferdium/recipes/dev/
                                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ google-gemini-mod/
                                    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
                                    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ webview.js
                                    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
                                    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (Optional: icon.svg/png if included)
        ```

    **Option B: Using Git (Fork & Clone - Advanced)**

    * **Fork** the repository containing this recipe to your own GitHub/GitLab account (if available).
    * **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine:
        ```bash
        git clone <your-fork-repository-url>
        ```
    * Navigate into the cloned directory and find the specific recipe folder (e.g., `google-gemini-mod`).
    * **Copy** this recipe folder into the Ferdium `dev` directory located in Step 1.

        *Alternatively*, you can clone the repository *directly* into the `dev` directory:

        ```bash
        # Navigate to Ferdium's dev recipes directory
        cd <path_to_ferdium_dev_recipes>

        # Clone the specific recipe repository (or your fork) into a folder named 'google-gemini-mod'
        git clone <repository-url> google-gemini-mod
        ```
        *(Ensure the final folder inside `dev` is named `google-gemini-mod` or matches the `id` in `package.json`)*

**3. Restart or Reload Ferdium:**

    * Completely quit and restart Ferdium.
    * *Or*, if Ferdium is running, use `Ctrl+Shift+R` / `Cmd+Shift+R` to reload Ferdium.

**4. Add the Custom Service:**

    * In Ferdium, click the "+" button to add a new service.
    * Click the "Own Services" Button (or search for the recipe name).
    * You should see your custom recipe listed (e.g., "Google Gemini Mod").
    * Select it and add the service as usual.

    The Google Gemini service should now load with the custom snippet toolbar at the top! üéâ

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

You can easily tailor the toolbar buttons and dropdowns to your needs by editing the `webview.js` file within the recipe's folder (`.../Ferdium/recipes/dev/google-gemini-mod/webview.js`).

Open `webview.js` in a text editor. Look for these sections near the top:

**1. Customizing Buttons:**

    Find the `buttonSnippets` array:
    ```javascript
    const buttonSnippets = [
      { label: "Greeting", text: "Hello Gemini!" },
      { label: "Explain", text: "Could you please explain ... in more detail?" },
      // Add more button snippets here
      // Example: { label: "My Button", text: "My snippet text..." }
    ];
    ```
    * **Edit:** Change the `label` (what appears on the button) and `text` (what gets inserted).
    * **Add:** Copy an existing line `{ label: "...", text: "..." },` and modify it.
    * **Remove:** Delete the line corresponding to the button you want to remove.

**2. Customizing Dropdowns:**

    Find the `dropdownConfigurations` array:
    ```javascript
    const dropdownConfigurations = [
      {
        placeholder: "Actions...", // Text shown before selection
        options: [
          { label: "Summarize", text: "Please summarize the following text:\n" },
          { label: "Ideas", text: "Give me 5 ideas for ..." },
          // Add more options here: { label: "Option Name", text: "Snippet..." }
        ]
      },
      {
        placeholder: "Translations",
        options: [
          { label: "DE -> EN", text: "Translate the following into English:\n" },
          { label: "EN -> DE", text: "Translate the following into German:\n" },
        ]
      },
      // Add more dropdown objects here
      // Example:
      // {
      //   placeholder: "My Prompts",
      //   options: [
      //     { label: "Blog Post Idea", text: "Generate 5 blog post ideas about..." },
      //     { label: "Email Draft", text: "Draft a polite email regarding..." }
      //   ]
      // }
    ];
    ```
    * **Edit Options:** Modify the `label` and `text` within the `options` array of a specific dropdown.
    * **Add Options:** Add more `{ label: "...", text: "..." }` objects to an existing `options` array.
    * **Edit Placeholder:** Change the `placeholder` text for a dropdown.
    * **Add Dropdowns:** Copy an entire dropdown object `{ placeholder: "...", options: [...] },` and customize it.
    * **Remove Dropdowns/Options:** Delete the relevant lines or objects.

**3. Customizing Download Behavior (Advanced):**

    The download functionality relies on specific CSS selectors to find the active Gemini "Canvas" and its internal "Copy to Clipboard" button. These are defined as constants in `webview.js`:
    ```javascript
    const GEMINI_CANVAS_WRAPPER_SELECTOR = "..."; // Identifies the main canvas container
    const GEMINI_CANVAS_TITLE_TEXT_SELECTOR = "..."; // Finds the title text within the canvas
    const GEMINI_CANVAS_COPY_BUTTON_SELECTOR = "..."; // CRITICAL: Finds the "Copy" button within the canvas
    ```
    If the download feature stops working after a Gemini UI update, these selectors (especially `GEMINI_CANVAS_COPY_BUTTON_SELECTOR`) might need to be updated by inspecting the Gemini webpage elements with browser developer tools.

**Important:** After saving changes to `webview.js`, you must reload the recipe in Ferdium for the changes to take effect:
* Right-click on the Gemini service tab in Ferdium and select "Reload service".
* Or, use the Development menu: "Reload Recipes" / "Reload Ferdium" (`Ctrl+Shift+R` / `Cmd+Shift+R`).

## üìù Notes
* The CSS styles are embedded directly in `webview.js` for compatibility with Google's security policies. You can modify the `embeddedCSS` constant within the script if you need to adjust the toolbar's appearance.
* Ensure you have a stable internet connection when using the service.
* The download feature relies on programmatic clicking of the canvas's "Copy" button and then reading from the clipboard. This requires clipboard permissions to be granted to the browser/Ferdium.
